# Capture The Flag – Crypto & Steganography Lab

This repository contains a three-part Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge
focused on cryptography, steganography, hashing, and file analysis.

The CTF is designed as a learning lab and academic submission.

## Overview
- Part 1: Web inspection, image steganography, Caesar cipher
- Part 2: MD5 verification, XOR decryption
- Part 3: Audio steganography, archive cracking, Python cryptography

## How to start
The challenge begins with a corrupted image file:
